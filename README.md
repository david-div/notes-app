# Note app

A single page app for taking notes

TDD'd using my own (still in progress) testing framwork

##### Setup
```
git clone git https://github.com/david-div/notes-app  
cd notes-app
npm install

open index.html
or
http-server and go to http://localhost:8080/
```

#### Running tests

```
open SpecRunner.html
```
Tests will be shown in the browser console window

###### Still to do:
 - make it look pretty
 - add more tests
 - refactor
 - format testing to show in browser window
